                    <p>Altiora was founded in May 2020 as an Overwatch-focused organisation hosting a mix of women's and
                        LGBTQA+ teams and mixed-gender open teams. Since then we've grown to host far more teams and our
                        events, production & mentorship divisions. We're always looking for more opportunities to
                        promote our mission - making esports communities better and kinder for everyone around us.</p>

                        “Non-toxic” is not enough - it should be the bare minimum. We must
                        be kind, we must lift others up, and we must make esports better for those around us.</p>

                        <strong>We see esports as a sport, not 'just a game', and that means it should have
                            dignity.</strong>
                        Honesty, fairness, integrity, responsibility and courtesy are key to sportsmanship.
                        Aspiring athletes should demonstrate graciousness in winning and losing, fellowship with one's
                        competitors, and genuine love for the game.</p>

                        passionately about inclusion and support for women, LGBTQIA+ individuals, people of colour,
                        disabled people and everyone else whose skills are unfairly underrated. </p>

                        <strong>Teams are stronger as part of a community.</strong> Everyone brings something unique to

                        events, sparring partners, advice or hype. When we come together to support one another, we
                        create an environment that everyone can thrive in.
